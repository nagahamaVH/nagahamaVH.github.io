      <description>In the last weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve started a selection process in a data science course sponsored by Codenation. To join in this program it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to be approved on the selection challenge, which was to predict the math scores of students of ENEM 2016.
ENEM is a college entrance exam applied in Brazil, students can get a position in public universities or a financial support. ENEM is the second biggest exam in the world.</description>

      <description>In my childhood me and my friends used to guess what would be the soccer Dream Team of the season. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t any metrics to compare our choices, so the results were doubtful.
Recently, I found this dataset about FIFA on Kaggle. The data contains the scores of 18.279 players in all of the 27 soccer positions (goalkeeper, centre forward, etc).
Motivated by my childhood I used this data and Linear Programming (LP) to find the set of players which sum maximizes the overall team score, in other words, the Dream Team.</description>
