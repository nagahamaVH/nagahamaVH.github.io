      <description>Victor Hugo Nagahama Bachelor in statistics, data scientist and aspiring musician. Nowadays I&amp;rsquo;m in residency program of HUB of Artificial Intelligence of SENAI.
I&amp;rsquo;m passionate with music in special Brazillian music. I try to live in between the worlds of data analysis, music and literature. By the way, why not hear my indie band Colombus St.?
The blog In this blog I have the opportunity to venture into data science and AI, some post are about real applications, studies, tips or even problems that you may not think to use data analysis in the first time.</description>

      <description>In the last weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve started a selection process in a data science course sponsored by Codenation. To join in this program it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to be approved on the selection challenge, which was to predict the math scores of students of ENEM 2016.
ENEM is a college entrance exam applied in Brazil, students can get a position in public universities or a financial support. ENEM is the second biggest exam in the world.</description>

      <description>In my childhood me and my friends used to guess what would be the soccer Dream Team of the season. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t any metrics to compare our choices, so the results were doubtful.
Recently, I found this dataset about FIFA on Kaggle. The data contains the scores of 18.279 players in all of the 27 soccer positions (goalkeeper, centre forward, etc).
Motivated by my childhood I used this data and Linear Programming (LP) to find the set of players which sum maximizes the overall team score, in other words, the Dream Team.</description>
